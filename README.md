# eFirefighter

The eFirefighter is a fire truck prototype that is wirelessly controlled by a smartphone application. 
It consists of electronic parts controlled by Arduino Uno, which is connected by Bluetooth with the mobile app. 


This project was made for multiple high school project olympiads, national and international, therefore it was time-limited,
the best national achievement was a silver medal (BOSEPO), the best international achievement was a gold medal (ISPrO).

## Used hardware
- Rover 5 Robot Platform
- Motor drive
- Arduino Uno
- Bluetooth modem
- Liquid pump
- Relay module
- and other parts...

## Software
An android app was developed, so the eFirefighter could be controlled from a smartphone, 
the app connects the phone by Bluetooth to the Bluetooth module that is connected to the Arduino, 
then sends commands to the Bluetooth module, the Bluetooth module sends commands to the Arduino, 
and the Arduino accordingly controls the eFirefighter.

The app was developed by MIT app inventor (a drag-and-drop-blocks-to-create-an-application code system, as shown below). 
The file eFirefighter.aia is the file type used in MIT app inventor (used for copying and/or editing code in another account), 
the file eFirefighter.apk is the executable android app.
